---------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT MISSING FEATURES: 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
* Web start (elm) [x]
* Filter bug (yij) [x]
* Reordering permutation [x]
* Time slider (for filtering) [x]
* Semantic zooming [x]
* Highlighting [x]
---------------------------------------------------------------------

General:
[?] Make sure to clear collapsed edges and nodes to allow GC to free up memory
[?] Make sure to invalidate elements that have changed 
[?] Implement a histogram aggregation class (with variable width buckets?) 
[X] Optimize rendering (it is too slow) - if we can't improve it, cut down on the scenario dataset
[X] Make sure to cache elements only in the overlays

Visual representation: 
[ ] Show hierarchy on row and column labels (elm)
[X] Semantic zooming of edges (TimeCells) (yij)
[?] Hierarchical matrix labels (columns and rows)
[?] Cell line graph visual representation
[?] Two-tone visual representation (?)
[X] Show basic aggregation on rows and labels (headers)  
[X] Hierarchical matrix visualization
[X] Cell bar chart visual representation

Overlays:
[?] Allow different visual representations as overlays
[?] Separate edge and node overlays?
[X] Allow different metrics as overlays 
[X] Implement alpha blending (transparency) changes
[X] Create the overlay layer window (color + toggle + transparency)
[X] Create overlays for all given and derived metrics (nodes and edges)
[X] Create resource management mechanism for building/storing/managing given and derived metrics
[X] Create compositor for building a single PNode for requested entities/resources 
[X] Add Statistical Overlays (Degree Centrality) (yij, elm)
[?] Add Statistical Overlays (Betweeness) (yij)

Refactoring:
[X] Clean up aggregation code
[X] Expose all node and edge data through the overlay mechanism
[X] Clean up cell visualization code

Layout:
[X] Add a panner with overview (yij)
[X] Introduce a layout manager common to both grid and labels
[X] Activate scroll bars for panning in the matrix 
[X] Scale text in labels correctly (to correct for non-uniform scaling of view transform) 
[X] Correct the center for row and column (to get correct zoom)
[X] Update row and column labels
[X] Introduce a scroll pane layout
[X] Store layout allocations for nesting

Data management and algorithms:
[X] Load computed permutation (elm)
[X] Sorting by attribute (alphabetical and reverse)
[X] Reordering algorithms (TSP-based)
[X] Cull empty nodes (in-degree and out-degree both zero) 

Aggregation:
[X] Node aggregation
[X] Temporal aggregation (same source and destination nodes)
[X] Aggregation hierarchy data structure
[X] Aggregate and basic aggregate implementation

User interface:
[ ] Allow resizing of scroll panes (viewport, columns, rows) 
[X] Range slider for temporal filtering (yij)
[X] Highlight rows and columns (brushing) (yij)
[X] Tooltips for drill down (elm)
[X] Menu bar (elm)
[X] Control panel to add user interface functionality

Interaction: 
[ ] Selecting nodes to aggregate (crossing/line) (elm)
[?] Direct (drag) reordering rows and columns (nodes) (elm) 
[?] Change row and column sizes 
[?] Selection lens and lens hierarchy (TableLens-inspired?)
[X] Navigation using scrollbars (pan, no zoom) (Ji Soo)
[X] Splitting aggregates
[X] Selecting edges to aggregate (rubberband)
[X] Zoom in/out using a mouse wheel (Ji Soo)

Statistics:
[X] Global vs local maxima for TimeCells (yij) - yij thinks that he has done this as well.
[?] Local statistics
[?] Global statistics
[X] Degree centrality (Ji Soo)
[?] Betweeness centrality (Ji Soo)

Storage: 
[?] Ability to save layouts and aggregation hierarchies
[?] Ability to load layouts and aggregation hierarchies

Bugs:
[?] Some edges disappear when aggregated (hard to replicate)
[X] Incorrect edge collapse (need to update in-edges)
[X] Incorrect edge aggregation
[X] Undirected graphs always have edges to nodes themselves
[X] Cell splitting (for collapse) of widths not working properly
