TimeMatrix
==========

TimeMatrix is a matrix-based visualization technique to present temporal change of network data. Visualization plays a crucial role in understanding dynamic social networks at many different levels (i.e., group, subgroup, and individual). Node-link-based visualization techniques are currently widely used for these tasks and have been demonstrated to be effective, but we found that they also have limitations in representing temporal changes, particularly at the individual and subgroup levels. To overcome these limitations, Drs. Niklas Elmqvist, Seungyoon Lee, and I developed a new network visualization technique, called "TimeMatrix," based on a matrix representation. Interaction techniques, such as overlay controls, a temporal range slider, semantic zooming, and integrated network statistical measures, support analysts in studying temporal social networks.
